    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical consists of four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **10:00**    Learn how to run WALRUS, look into the model structure and get a\n",
    "    feel for the effect of parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **10:45**    Perform some case studies to experience how WALRUS can be used in\n",
    "    practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **11:45**    Apply several techniques to obtain optimal parameter values for a\n",
    "    specific catchment.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **12:30**    Predict a flood peak in the Bakelse Aa catchment using your\n",
    "    calibrated model (the final assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to do all exercises, but make sure you start with the\n",
    "four parts at approximately the appointed time. For every\n",
    "section/exercise there are separate scripts in the `scripts` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run WALRUS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can run WALRUS, you should install the [WALRUS-package](../zip_files/lowlands_WALRUS4.zip) and the packages it requires. Open the script `install_WALRUS_packages.R` from the folder `scripts` in RStudio and run everything (for example by\n",
    "pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+S`). Make sure you don't get errors. Warnings are no problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base script \n",
    "\n",
    "First you will run WALRUS in a basic application. Open the script\n",
    "`basic_example.R` in RStudio. This script is also discussed in Sec. 6.1\n",
    "of the user manual [@WALRUSmanual provided in the documentation-folder].\n",
    "Go through the script line by line, read the comments and look what\n",
    "happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, packages are loaded and data are read. In l. 30 you make the data\n",
    "suitable for the model using a special WALRUS-function. In the\n",
    "background, the time series are transformed into functions for\n",
    "cumulative rainfall, evapotranspiration, etc., which are necessary for\n",
    "the flexible time step approach. If you want to run WALRUS with a larger\n",
    "time step than the original data, you can increase `dt` (for example\n",
    "`dt=24` if you have hourly data and want to run WALRUS with a daily\n",
    "resolution).\n",
    "\n",
    "In l. 39--40 you give values for all parameters and catchment\n",
    "characteristics. You can supply initial values for states (i.e.\n",
    "groundwater depth -- `dG0`, storage deficit -- `dV0`, water level in the\n",
    "quickflow reservoir -- `hQ0` and/or surface water level -- `hS0`), but\n",
    "are not obliged to (see Sec. 6.3 in the manual for all options).\n",
    "\n",
    "In l. 48 the model is finally run. This can take a while, depending on\n",
    "the length of the modelled period, the step size and parameter values\n",
    "(one year with hourly values takes about 20 sec.). The name you give to\n",
    "a run (l. 56) is used to write data files and figures to file (l. 59).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "During postprocessing, figures are made, the water budget is computed\n",
    "and files with model output are made. On the screen, the water balance\n",
    "(bottom left) and figures appear (bottom right). Look in the folders\n",
    "`output` and `figures` and open the exported files to see how they are\n",
    "set up (see Sec. 6.1 in the manual for explanation about the files).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the output without postprocessing. This is especially\n",
    "useful during automatic calibration\n",
    "(Sec. [4](#sec:kal){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:kal\"}), when you\n",
    "don't want to lose time making figures of intermediate results. Finally,\n",
    "you can use the output as input for another model (e.g. a hydrodynamic\n",
    "model such as SOBEK).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run WALRUS with data from another catchment, with another period of\n",
    "with other parameters, you can change the belonging line in the script.\n",
    "After that, you have to run WALRUS again of course (l. 48). Change the\n",

    "## Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, the influence of parameter values on model performance\n",
    "is very large. For a realistic model run, it is essential that the\n",
    "chosen parameter values are suitable for the catchment in question.\n",
    "Unfortunately, it is not easy to find those parameter values. For this\n",
    "exercise you will search for good parameter values for the catchment of\n",
    "the Bakelse Aa [@Slenters2014]. Scripts are available for guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also use this catchment also for the final assignment. Make\n",
    "sure you start with the final assignment no later than 12:30.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward calibration method is manually. For the\n",
    "calibration procedure, you perform the following steps several times:\n",
    "adjust parameter values (l. 39--40), run (l. 48), and evaluate the\n",
    "output (l. 59). You do this until you are satisfied with the results.\n",
    "With some feeling for parameter values and by looking at time series of\n",
    "all model variables, you can steer WALRUS in the right direction.\n",
    "Sec. 7.1 of the WALRUS manual contains tips for calibration, attention\n",
    "points to and solutions for several problems. Which values did you find\n",
    "for:\\\n",
    "`cW`: `cG`: `cQ`: You can also change the soil type (`st`), channel\n",
    "depth (`cD`), fraction suface water (`aS`) or bankful discharge (`cS`).\n",
    "Usually, you base these values on catchment characterstics, but these\n",
    "estimates are uncertain. The model is usually not very sentitive to\n",
    "parameter `cV`, so this parameter is fixed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration can also be automated. There are many different calibration\n",
    "algorithms, often implemented in R packages. As an example, you use the\n",
    "relatively simple method of Levenberg-Marquardt here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the limited time available during this practical, the chosen\n",
    "period is short and the period and the temporal resolution low. An\n",
    "additional preprocessing step (l. 32) produces a vector with observed\n",
    "discharges (`Qobs_forNS`), to which the modelled discharge will be\n",
    "compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide initial values (where the calibration algorithm will start\n",
    "\"walking\" in the parameter space) and boundaries of realistic values for\n",
    "every parameter you want to calibrate (l. 44--46). Normalise the\n",
    "parameter values (with the values from l. 49), because it is beneficial\n",
    "for the calibration algorithm when all parameter values are in the same\n",
    "order of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function has been built around the `WALRUS_loop` function (l. 53--60),\n",
    "for which the input is a parameter set (a vector, so not a data frame)\n",
    "and the output is a vector with residuals\n",
    "($Q_\\mathrm{obs}-Q_\\mathrm{mod}$). The sum of squares of these residuals\n",
    "is minimized during calibration. Test whether the starting values are\n",
    "realistic first (l. 63--76), because most calibration techniques\n",
    "(including the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) are sensitive to these\n",
    "starting values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling the function `nls.lm` starts the calibration with starting and\n",
    "end values, the adjusted model function and additional arguments for the\n",
    "calibration process (the maximum number of iterations is very low here).\n",
    "Calibrate WALRUS, retrieve the resulting parameter values (l. 87--93)\n",
    "and run the model once more with these values to save the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which values did you find for:\\\n",
    "`cW`: `cG`: `cQ`: If time allows, try starting with different values,\n",
    "using another period and/or another time step to assess the sensitivity\n",
    "of the found parameter values to the choices you made during\n",
    "calibration. Which other values did you find?\\\n",
    "`cW`: `cG`: `cQ`:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling the parameter space\n",
    "\n",
    "A third option is to run the model with a large number of parameter\n",
    "sets. These parameters can be drawn randomly within a certain range\n",
    "(Monte Carlo) or sampled more cleverly to save computational time\n",
    "(e.g. Latin Hypercube Sampling). WALRUS has been run with 1000 random\n",
    "parameter sets for the Bakelse Aa catchment, using one year and hourly\n",
    "resolution. The code is provided in l. 39--68 (now commented). Because\n",

    "is provided. Open the file `pars_MC_BakelseAa.dat` from the\n",
    "`output`-folder in Notepad to look at the structure.\n",
    "\n",
